\b0 From a motorway service area to her ambivalent relationship with religion, Wendy Cope covers a wide range of experience in her new collection. Her mordant humour and formal ingenuity are in evidence, even as she remembers the wounds of a damaging childhood; and in poems about love and the inevitable problems of aging she achieves an intriguing blend of sadness and joy. Two very different sets of commissioned poems round off a remarkable volume, whose opening poem sounds clearly the profound note of compassion which underlies the whole. TB 18802.\

\b\fs32 Abse, Dannie\

\fs28 The presence. 2008. Read by Christopher Oxford, 8 hours 5 minutes. TB 16245.\

\b0 Loss, grief and love are the themes of this memoir from one of Britain's most distinguished poets. Some months after Dannie Abse's wife Joan died in a car accident in June 2005, he began to write a diary which is both a record of present grief and a portrait of marriage which lasted more than fifty years. It is an extraordinary document, painful but celebratory; funny as well as sad, bursting with joy as well as sorrow and full of a deep understanding of what it means to be human. TB 16245.\
\

\b\fs32 Ackroyd, Peter\

\fs28 T S Eliot. 1984. Read by Robert Gladwell, 17 hours 4 minutes. TB 5924.\

\b0 The image that T.S. Eliot presented to the outside world was that of a successful public man - a unique poet, an established speaker and an important publisher. Behind the mask, however, was a secret, enigmatic man who remained something of a mystery even to his closest friends. This is a detailed portrait of a very private man. TB 5924.\
\

\

\b\fs32 Coote, Stephen\

\fs28 John Keats: a life. 1996. Read by Richard Burnip, 16 hours 10 minutes. TB 16748.\

\b0 John Keats is described as the last of the great romantic poets, and his brief life, full of poetry, epitomizes the image of tragic genius. The author here reveals Keats to be a man of his time, rediscovering a poet who reacted strongly against an authoritarian state and tried to find a spiritual life free from the repressive Christianity of 19th-century England. This book throws much new light on the poems, showing why they were so bitterly attacked, and reveals Keats as a man of real vitality, profoundly original and deeply human. TB 16748.\
\

\b\fs32 Fitzgibbon, Constantine\

\fs28 The life of Dylan Thomas. 1965. Read by Judith Whale, 16 hours 45 minutes. TB 214.\

\

\b\fs32 Forster, Margaret\

\fs28 Elizabeth Barrett Browning: a biography. 1988. Read by Judith Whale, 19 hours 26 minutes. TB 7299.\

\b0 Elizabeth had a happy childhood and, using new material, the author shows her to be no frail and terrified daughter of a Victorian tyrant but a determined woman largely responsible for her own incarceration. She chose the life of a poet, little dreaming that it might be possible to add wife and mother to her chosen role. Death came in her fifties but, through her own courage and will, she enjoyed complete fulfilment in those last 12 years. TB 7299.\
\

\b\fs32 Gill, Stephen\

\fs28 William Wordsworth: a life. 1989. Read by Richard Owens, 21 hours 56 minutes. TB 7953.\

\b0 Although he never made any money by his writing, Wordsworth's dedication to his art never wavered. His triumph was hard won - the critics reviled his work but his poetry is full of human understanding and experience. The old notion that the old man betrayed the radical young one to become a prosy old Tory is not the whole story as this new appraisal draws out. TB 7953.\
\

\b\fs32 Glendinning, Victoria\

\fs28 Edith Sitwell: a unicorn among lions. 1981. Read by Gretel Davis, 17 hours 39 minutes. TB 4324.\

\

\b\fs32 Holmes, Richard\

\fs28 Coleridge: early visions. 1998. Read by Crawford Logan, 17 hours 9 minutes. TB 11835.\

\b0 The author, Richard Holmes' intention is to draw the reader into the labyrinthine complications of his subject's personality and literary power, until we are left facing profound questions about the nature of creativity, the relations between sexuality and friendship, the shifting grounds of political and religious belief, and the limits of self-knowledge - and biographic knowledge itself. TB 11835.\
\

\b\fs32 Holmes, Richard\

\fs28 Coleridge.1998. Read by Crawford Logan, 24 hours 59 minutes. TB 12047. \

\b0 Sequel to: Coleridge, early visions. The text traces the development of Coleridge from a legend amongst the younger generation of Romantic writers such as Byron, Shelly and Keats amongst others, to his power as a conversationalist and a ceaseless generator of ideas. Coleridge's later life is concerned with his hopeless heartache, disappointments, addictions to Asra and opium, his elated highs and catastropic lows, his electrifying creativity and boundless energy, and never-failing ability to rescue himself from the darkest abyss. TB 12047.\
\

\b\fs32 Kay, Jackie\

\fs28 Red dust road. 2011. Read by Jackie Kay, 8 hours 5 minutes. TB 18617.\

\b0 From the moment when, as a little girl, she realizes that her skin is a different colour from that of her beloved mum and dad, to the tracing and finding of her birth parents, her Highland mother and Nigerian father, Jackie Kay's journey in Red Dust Road is one of unexpected twists, turns and deep emotions. In a book remarkable for its warmth and candour, she discovers that inheritance is about much more than genes: that we are shaped by songs as much as by cells, and that what triumphs, ultimately, is love. TB 18617.\

\

\b\fs32 Kitchen, Paddy\

\fs28 Gerard Manley Hopkins: a life. 1989. Read by Kate Moon, 10 hours 17 minutes. TB 7994.\

\b0 This personal, rather than academic, life of Gerard Manley Hopkins looks at the life of this remarkable poet from childhood, university, his time as a Jesuit through to his death. This illustrative work studies the "misery and ecstasy" of his life which he describes so perfectly in his work. TB 7994.\
\

\fs28 Rupert Brooke: his life and his legend. 1980. Read by John Richmond, 8 hours 2 minutes. TB 3660.\

\

\b\fs32 McNeil, Helen\

\fs28 Emily Dickinson. 1986. Read by Gretel Davis, TB 6413.\

\b0 Emily Dickinson saw only 10 of her 1700 poems published in her lifetime. The author argues that the absence of a readership during her lifetime gave her poetry its unique freedom in an era when women were encouraged to write, only so long as they wrote badly or with sentiment. TB 6413.\
\

\b\fs32 Morrison, Blake\

\fs28 And when did you last see your father? 1998. Read by Gordon Reid, 7 hours 55 minutes. TB 11734.\

\b0 This is Blake Morrison's memoir of his father, Dr Arthur Morrison. It shows a son asking who his father really was. Was he the man seen through a seven-year-old's eyes, jumping queues, or the sexual charmer seen by a 17 year old? Or was he the figure, so hard to recognise, on his deathbed? Contains strong language. TB 11734.\
\

\b\fs32 O'Brien, Edna\

\fs28 Byron in love. 2009. Read by Grainne Gillis, 6 hours 54 minutes. TB 17902.\

\b0 Byron, more than any other poet, has come to personify the poet as rebel, imaginative and lawless, reaching beyond race, creed or frontier, his gigantic flaws redeemed by a magnetism and ultimately a heroism that by ending in tragedy raised it and him from the particular to the universal. Everything about Lord George Gordon Byron was a paradox - insider and outsider, beautiful and deformed, serious and facetious, profligate but on occasion miserly, and possessed of a fierce intelligence trapped forever in a child's magic and malice. He was also a great poet, but as he reminded us, poetry is a distinct faculty and has little to do with the individual life of its creator. TB 17902.\
\

\fs28 W H Auden: the life of a poet. 1980. Read by Robin Holmes, 14 hours 36 minutes. TB 3654.\

\fs28 Diaries: 1915-1918. 1918. Read by John Westbrook, 11 hours 42 minutes. TB 4808.\

\b0 Sassoon wrote his diaries in tiny note-books, often by the light of a solitary candle in a dug-out or billet. However, even away from the front-line, the physical and emotional scars of war were evident and he suffered the personal loss of acquaintances such as Wilfred Owen. TB 4808.\
\

\b\fs32 Storey, Edward\

\fs28 A right to song: the life of John Clare. 1982. Read by Robin Holmes, 15 hours 4 minutes. TB 4621.\

\fs28 John Betjeman: his life and work. 1983. Read by Brian Perkins, 7 hours 46 minutes. TB 4843.\
